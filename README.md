## JOCC

This is an implementation of an appraisal transition system for event-driven emotions, based on the [OCC theory of emotions](https://doi-org.proxy.library.uu.nl/10.1017/CBO9780511571299). The main use case of this library is for automated player experience (PX) testing. The implementation includes 6 out of 22 of the emotion types in the OCC theory, which are most directly relevant for PX testing.

The formal theory behind this implementation is presented in this paper:
